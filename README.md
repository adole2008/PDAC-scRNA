Bioinformatics project using the GSE278688 (GEO) dataset to elucidate what role the environment (specifically the environment surrounding invaded nerves/non invaded nerves) plays in the staging/development of TLS formation.

All data is publically available on GEO, and it is from the 2025 study "Integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptomics uncover distinct cellular subtypes involved in neural invasion in pancreatic cancer" (Chen et al.)
