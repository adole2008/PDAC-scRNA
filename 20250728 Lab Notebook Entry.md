- Started data preprocessing steps
- Created adata matrix from GSE278688 cell-by-gene matrix using Scanpy
- Filtered out cells with low gene expression & genes that were found in very few cells
- Annotated mitochondrial, hemoglobin, and ribosomal genes in the adata and calculated QC metrics based on those genes
- Created violin plot for n_genes_by_counts, total_counts, and pct_counts_mt
- Created scatter plot for pct_counts_mt
